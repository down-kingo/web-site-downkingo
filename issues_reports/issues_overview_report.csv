"Content: Readability Difficult","Opportunity","Low","5","9,260","Copy on the page is difficult to read and best understood by college graduates according to the Flesch reading-ease score formula. Copy that has long sentences and uses complex words are generally harder to read and understand.","Consider improving the readability of copy for your target audience. Copy that uses shorter sentences with less complex words is often easier to read and understand.",""
"Response Codes: External Client Error (4xx)","Warning","Low","1","0,480","External URLs with a client-side error. This indicates a problem occurred with the URL request and can include responses such as 400 bad request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Page Not Found, 410 Removed, 429 Too Many Requests and more. A 404 'Page Not Found' is the most common, and often referred to as a broken link. View URLs that link to errors using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > External > Client Error (4xx) inlinks'.","All links on a website should ideally resolve to 200 'OK' URLs. Errors such as 404 broken links should be updated so users are taken to the correct URL, or removed. A 403 forbidden error occurs when a web server denies access to the SEO Spider's request and can often be resolved by switching the user-agent to Chrome via 'Config > User-Agent'. If they can be viewed in a browser, then it's often not an issue.",""
"Page Titles: Over 60 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","10","18,520","Pages which have page titles that exceed the configured limit. Characters over this limit might be truncated in Google's search results and carry less weight in scoring.","Write concise page titles to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, not visible to users and potentially weighted less in scoring.",""
"H1: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","6","11,110","Pages which have duplicate <h1>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful main headings. If every page has the same <h1>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h1>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h1> for users and search engines.  If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"H1: Multiple","Warning","Medium","3","5,560","Pages which have multiple <h1>s. While this is not strictly an issue because HTML5 standards allow multiple <h1>s on a page, there are some problems with this modern approach in terms of usability. It's advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure. The classic HTML4 standard defines there should only be a single <h1> per page, and this is still generally recommended for users and SEO.","Consider updating the HTML to include a single <h1> on each page, and utilising the full heading rank between (h2 - h6) for additional headings.",""
"Links: Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text","Opportunity","Low","14","25,930","Pages that have internal links without anchor text or images that are hyperlinked without alt text. Anchor text is the visible text and words used in hyperlinks that provide users and search engines context about the content of the target page. Internal outlinks without anchor text can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks', where the 'Anchor Text' column is blank, or if an image, the 'Alt Text' column is also blank. Export in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Links > Internal Outlinks With No Anchor Text'.","Review the missing anchor text outlinks and where appropriate include useful and descriptive anchor text to help users and search engines.",""

"Response Codes: Internal Redirection (3xx)","Warning","Low","52","25,120","Internal URLs which redirect to another URL. These will include server-side redirects, such as 301 or 302 redirects (and more). View URLs that link to redirects using the lower 'inlinks' tab and export them in bulk via 'Bulk Export > Response Codes > Internal > Redirection (3xx) inlinks'.","Ideally all internal links would be to canonical resolving URLs, and avoid linking to URLs that redirect. This reduces latency of redirect hops for users, and enhanced efficiency for search engines.",""
"Page Titles: Duplicate","Opportunity","Medium","2","3,700","Pages which have duplicate page titles. It's really important to have distinct and unique page titles for every page. If every page has the same page title, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate page titles as necessary, so each page contains a unique and descriptive title for users and search engines. If these are duplicate pages, then fix the duplicated pages by linking to a single version, and redirect or use canonicals where appropriate.",""
"H2: Multiple","Warning","Low","49","90,740","Pages which have multiple <h2>s. This is not an issue as HTML standards allow multiple <h2>'s when used in a logical hierarchical heading structure.

"Links: Pages With High External Outlinks","Warning","Low","12","22,220","Pages that have a high number of followed external outlinks on them based upon the 'High External Outlinks' preferences under 'Config > Spider > Preferences'. External outlinks are hyperlinks to another subdomain or domain (depending on your configuration). This might be completely valid, such as linking to another part of the same root domain, or linking to other useful websites. External followed outlinks can be seen in the 'Outlinks' tab, with the 'All Link Types' filter set to 'Hyperlinks' where the 'Follow' column is 'True'.","Review followed external outlinks to ensure they are to credible, trusted and relevant websites that are useful to your users.",""
"Security: Missing X-Frame-Options Header","Warning","Low","85","61,590","URLs missing an X-Frame-Options response header with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value. This instructs the browser not to render a page within a frame, iframe, embed or object. This helps avoid 'clickjacking' attacks, where your content is displayed on another web page that is controlled by an attacker.","To minimise security issues, the X-Frame-Options response header should be supplied with a 'DENY' or 'SAMEORIGIN' value.",""
"Content: Low Content Pages","Opportunity","Medium","7","12,960","Pages with a word count that is below the default 200 words. The word count is based upon the content area settings used in the analysis which can be configured via 'Config > Content > Area'. There isn't a minimum word count for pages in reality, but the search engines do require descriptive text to understand the purpose of a page. This filter should only be used as a rough guide to help identify pages that might be improved by adding more descriptive content in the context of the website and page's purpose. Some websites, such as ecommerce, will naturally have lower word counts, which can be acceptable if a products details can be communicated efficiently.","Consider including additional descriptive content to help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"Security: Missing HSTS Header","Warning","Low","85","61,590","URLs that are missing the HSTS response header. The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (HSTS) instructs browsers that it should only be accessed using HTTPS, rather than HTTP. If a website accepts a connection to HTTP, before being redirected to HTTPS, visitors will initially still communicate over HTTP. The HSTS header instructs the browser to never load over HTTP and to automatically convert all requests to HTTPS.","The HSTS header should be used across all pages to instruct the browser that it should always request pages via HTTPS, rather than HTTP.",""
"H2: Duplicate","Opportunity","Low","17","31,480","Pages which have duplicate <h2>s. It's important to have distinct, unique and useful pages. If every page has the same <h2>, then it can make it more challenging for users and the search engines to understand one page from another.","Update duplicate <h2>s as necessary, so important pages contain a unique and descriptive <h2> for users and search engines.

"Meta Description: Over 985 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","14","25,930","Pages which have meta descriptions over Google's estimated pixel length limit for snippets. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length. The SEO Spider tries to match the latest pixel truncation points in the SERPs, but it is an approximation and Google adjusts them frequently.","Write concise meta descriptions to ensure important words are not truncated in the search results, and not visible to users.",""
"Images: Alt Text Over 100 Characters","Opportunity","Low","3","13,040","Images which have one instance of alt text over a threshold of characters in length. This is not strictly an issue, however image alt text should be concise and descriptive.

"Meta Description: Below 400 Pixels","Opportunity","Low","4","7,410","Pages which have meta descriptions much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to communicate benefits, USPs or call to actions.","Consider updating the meta description to take advantage of the space left to include additional benefits, USPs or call to actions to improve click through rates (CTR).",""
"Images: Over 100 KB","Opportunity","Medium","6","26,090","Large images over a size threshold. Page speed is extremely important for users and SEO and often large resources such as images are one of the most common issues that slow down web pages. This filter simply acts as a general rule of thumb to help identify images that are fairly large in file size and may take longer to load. These should be considered for optimisation, alongside opportunities identified in the PageSpeed tab which uses the PSI API and Lighthouse to audit speed. This can help identify images that haven't been optimised in size, load offscreen, are unoptimised etc.","Uncompressed images bloat pages with unnecessary bytes, so ensure images are optimised with compression, properly scaled, and using the best image format to reduce file size where possible.",""
"Security: Missing Content-Security-Policy Header","Warning","Low","85","61,590","URLs that are missing the Content-Security-Policy response header. This header allows a website to control which resources are loaded for a page. This policy can help guard against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. The SEO Spider only checks for existence of the header, and does not interrogate the policies found within the header to determine whether they are well set-up for the website. This should be performed manually.","Set a strict Content-Security-Policy response header across all page to help mitigate cross site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.",""
"H2: Missing","Warning","Low","2","3,700","Pages which have a missing <h2>, the content is empty or has a whitespace. The <h2> heading is often used to describe sections or topics within a document. They act as signposts for the user, and can help search engines understand the page.","Consider using logical and descriptive <h2>s on important pages that help the user and search engines better understand the page.",""
"H1: Non-Sequential","Warning","Low","5","9,260","Pages with an <h1> that is not the first heading on the page. Heading elements should be in a logical sequentially-descending order. The purpose of heading elements is to convey the structure of the page and they should be in logical order from <h1> to <h6>, which helps navigating the page and users that rely on assistive technologies.","Ensure the <h1> is the first heading on the page. Headings should be in a logical sequential order from <h1> to <h6>. Review and update page heading levels so they are descending in order, for example the first heading level should be an <h1>, and this should be followed by an <h2>.",""
"Canonicals: Canonicalised","Warning","High","1","1,850","Pages that have a canonical to a different URL. The URL is 'canonicalised' to another location. This means the search engines are being instructed to not index the page, and the indexing and linking properties should be consolidated to the URL in the canonical.","These URLs should be reviewed carefully to ensure the indexing and link signals are being consolidated to the correct URL. In a perfect world, a website wouldn't need to canonicalise any URLs as only canonical versions would be linked to internally on a website, but often they are required due to various circumstances outside of control, and to prevent duplicate content. Update internal links to canonical versions of URLs where possible.",""
"Security: Bad Content Type","Warning","Low","2","1,450","This indicates any URLs where the actual content type does not match the content type set in the header. It also identifies any invalid MIME types used. When the X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff response header is set by the server this is particularly important, as browsers rely on the content type header to correctly process the page. This can cause HTML web pages to be downloaded instead of being rendered when they are served with a MIME type other than text/html for example.","Analyse URLs identified with a bad content type, and set an accurate MIME type in the content-type header.",""
"Page Titles: Below 200 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","2","3,700","Pages which have page titles much shorter than Google's estimated pixel length limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs.",""
"Hreflang: Missing X-Default","Warning","Low","5","9,260","URLs missing an x-default hreflang attribute. This is optional, and not necessarily an issue.","Consider adding a fallback page for unmatched languages, especially on language/country selectors or auto-redirecting homepages.",""
"Page Titles: Below 30 Characters","Opportunity","Medium","6","11,110","Pages which have page titles under the configured limit. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it does indicate there might be room to target additional keywords or communicate your USPs.","Consider updating the page title to take advantage of the space left to include additional target keywords or USPs.",""
"Meta Description: Below 70 Characters","Opportunity","Low","4","7,410","Pages which have meta descriptions below the configured limit. This isn't strictly an issue, but an opportunity. There is additional room to communicate benefits, USPs or call to actions.","Consider updating the meta description to take advantage of the space left to include additional benefits, USPs or call to actions to improve click through rates (CTR).",""
"Page Titles: Over 561 Pixels","Opportunity","Medium","13","24,070","Pages which have page titles over Google's estimated pixel length limit for titles in search results. Google snippet length is actually based upon pixels limits, rather than a character length.
